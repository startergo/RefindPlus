##               ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION ITEMS                 ##
##             New Features Provided by RefindPlus              ##
##--------------------------------------------------------------##
#
#
# RefindPlus defaults to storing the name of the last booted loader in
# a "PreviousBoot" variable in the NVRAM under the RefindPlus GUID. This
# provides a default option to be selected on the main screen when RefindPlus
# is loaded. This can however increase wear and tear on the NVRAM and disabling
# the "use_nvram" token allows writing to the filesystem instead to reduce this.
# On some setups however, such as when the "default_selection" token is set,
# such writes are not required at all and when this option is active,
# RefindPlus will not exexute such writes at all.
#
# Always saves the "PreviousBoot" variable when commented out
#
#ignore_previous_boot

# The SimpleText protocol on the ConsoleOut handle is normally used to
# output text. On Macs and some other firmware, this is complicated by
# the ConsoleControl protocol which determines whether to output text,
# graphics, or both, and this often results in an inability to display
# text or to run tools that require text output, such as EFI Shell. A
# text renderer is added on top of GOP by this option as a workaround.
# Note that this setting is forced on whenever text output is required,
# such as when running EFI Shell or whenever RefindPlus is changed to
# text mode as part of its operations (Typically to handle errors).
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore Builds
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not use a custom text renderer)
#
#text_renderer

# Adds the UGA Protocol to GOP when absent. This option allows the RefindPlus
# screen when using modern GPUs on units with only EFIBoot capability.
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore Builds
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not add UGA to GOP)
#
#uga_pass_through

# Some computers may have multiple GOP instances:
#     - One installed on the ConsoleOut handle
#     - Others installed on GPU handles.
# GOP on the ConsoleOut Handle is what everything uses and is provided by
# the system firmware and others provided by GPU firmware. The firmware
# should typically forward calls from the ConsoleOut Handle GOP to the
# others transparently. On such models, it only works in this way with
# GPUs with system firmware support. This option replaces GOP on the
# ConsoleOut Handle with one from a GPU Handle on such models when
# running compatible GPUs without system firmware support.
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore Builds
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not provide ConsoleOut GOP)
#
#provide_console_gop

# When GOP drivers, which are UEFI 2.x drivers, are implemented in complinace with
# UEFI 2.x requirements, they do not work on legacy devices as the specifications
# mandate that on installation, compliant GOP drivers should confirm devices are
# UEFI 2.x compliant and to fail if they are not. Hence, compliant GOP drivers
# do not activate on Classic MacPros for instance, as these are not actually
# UEFI 2.x devices but EFI 1.x devices to which Apple has added a chunk of, but
# not all of, the UEFI 2.x capabilities. When this token is activated, RefindPlus
# will temporarily amend the device EFI Revision to UEFI 2.x, emulate the UEFI 2.x
# CreateEventEx capability and attempt reinstalling a copy of the GPU's Option ROM
# whenever it detects that GOP is not available. RefindPlus will revert the changes
# made after the attempted reinstallation. This process allows running some modern
# GPUs, notably from Nvidia, on legacy computers such as Classic MacPros when they
# would otherwise fail to work. This token should be deactivated when using GPUs
# with UGA graphics mode as they do not benefit from this feature.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not reinstall GOP)
#
#reinstall_gop

# Use a built-in GOP renderer which may provide better performance
# and fix rendering issues on some GPU/firmware combinations such as
# the Radeon VII and some versions of the Radeon 5700 XT. However,
# this should only be used when there is an obvious benefit as it
# may result in glitches in the pre-boot configuration screen or
# slow scrolling response on booting into the operating system.
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore Builds
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not use the built-in GOP)
#
#direct_gop_renderer

# Proceed automatically when notices are shown on-screen instead
# of having to press a key to continue. When this option is active,
# RefindPlus will pause for three seconds when on-screen warnings
# are shown and then proceed as if a key had been pressed.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not proceed automatically)
#
#continue_on_warning

# Force "TRIM" on non-Apple SSDs. "TRIM", which may improve SSD health,
# is inactive by default for non-Apple SSDs in Mac OS. When this option
# is active, RefindPlus will force Mac OS "TRIM" on for all SSDs types
# including on non-Apple SSDs. This setting only applies to Mac OS. Note
# that this setting will create a Mac OS NVRAM entry the first time it is
# triggered and that this will stay active until explicitly cleared even
# if the setting is subsequently disabled. Also note that forcing "TRIM"
# may significantly increase boot times and that enabling "TRIM" on
# non-Apple SSDs may affect the integrity of data on such SSDs.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not force "TRIM" on non-Apple SSDs)
#
#force_trim

# Disable Mac OS compatibility check when booting. Macs check whether the
# current Mac OS version is supported on the machine when booting and halts
# if not. When this option is active, RefindPlus will set the "-no_compat_check"
# boot argument which disables this check and allows boot to proceed on otherwise
# unsupported Macs. This setting only applies to Mac OS. Note that this setting will
# create a Mac OS boot argument the first time it is triggered and that this will stay
# active until explicitly cleared even if the setting is subsequently disabled.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not disable the compatibility check)
#
#disable_compat_check

# Disable Apple Mobile File Integrity (AMFI) checks. When this option is active,
# RefindPlus will set the "amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1" boot argument which along with
# System Integrity Protection (SIP), restricts access to entitlements by applications.
# This setting only applies to Mac OS. Note that this setting will create a Mac OS
# boot argument the first time it is triggered and that this will stay active
# until explicitly cleared even if the setting is subsequently disabled.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not disable AMFI checks)
#
#disable_amfi

# Supply APFS filesystem capability. When this option is active, RefindPlus loads
# Mac OS APFS filesystem drivers, apfs.efi, which are available in system folders of
# Mac OS 10.13 (High Sierra) and later. The drivers are loaded to match each specific
# Mac OS version and this ensures that changes made by Apple to the drivers for different
# Mac OS versions are accounted for as compared to loading a single APFS driver for every
# Mac OS versions in use. This setting only applies to Mac OS and only functions if needed.
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore Builds
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not supply APFS filesystem capability)
#
#supply_apfs

# Suppress verbose APFS loading text output. When this option is active, RefindPlus will
# suppress verbose text output from APFS drivers loaded via the "supply_apfs" option.
# This option only acts on apfs drivers loaded by RefindPlus using "supply_apfs".
# This option may impact other text output and should be disabled if such
# negative effects are observed. This setting only applies to Mac OS.
# NB: This functionality is only available on TianoCore Builds
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not suppress verbose APFS text)
#
#suppress_verbose_apfs

# Apple has partially enforced the use of the Pre-Boot Loader stored in the "PreBoot" partitions
# of APFS volumes by requiring this to run the Mac OS Boot Loader in Mac OS v11.0 (Big Sur) when
# SIP is enabled. Attempts to run the Mac OS 11.0 Boot Loader directly with SIP enabled result
# in kernel panics. When this option is activated, RefindPlus will map APFS volumes to their
# respective "PreBoot" partitions which will be used to boot such Mac OS instances while the
# "PreBoot" partitions will be hidden from view. This feature also facilitates directly
# booting into FileVault encrypted APFS volumes without requiring "PreBoot" partitions.
# NB: Maintain the default naming pattern for APFS data volumes, "VolName - Data", to
# improve the reliability of this option in distinguishing between APFS partitions.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not map APFS volumes to PreBoot partitions)
#
#sync_apfs

# Prevent UEFI Windows "Secure Boot" from writing to Apple NVRAM. When this option is active,
# RefindPlus will prevent UEFI Windows Secure Boot from writing to the NVRAM on Apple Firmware
# as this can lead to damage resulting in an inability to boot. Legacy Windows does not have
# this issue and is recommended instead when running Windows on Apple Firmware.
# This setting only applies when loading Windows on Apple Firmware.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not prevent UEFI Windows writes to Apple NVRAM)
#
#protect_nvram

# Allow scans of multiple ESPs. When this option is active, RefindPlus
# will make other ESPs, separate from that containing RefindPlus,
# available to be scanned for kernels and loaders.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not make other ESPs available)
#
#scan_other_esp

# RefindPlus will automatically enlarge icons and text when HiDPI screens are detected.
# The detection is basic and based on detecting a minimum 1601px vertical resolution.
# This setting allows overriding the detection as follows:
#  -1    - Never scale UI elements up
#   0    - Scale UI elements up, or not, based on screen resolution
#   1    - Always scale UI elements up
#
# Scales UI elements based on screen resolution when commented out
#
#scale_ui 1

# This token allows actively enabling or disabling the System Intergrity Protection (SIP)
# and Sealed System Volume (SSV) settings defined under the "csr_values" option. When this
# token is active, RefindPlus will actively set the CSR Policy as defined. This is done when
# RefindPlus is loaded but users can manually toggle the set values "ON" or "OFF" by using the
# "Toggle Mac CSR" tool after RefindPlus is loaded.
# The following options are available:
#  -1    - Always Disable SIP (and SSV, if configured under "csr_values" and on Mac OS 11.x)
#   0    - Take no Action
#   1    - Always Enable SIP (and SSV, if on Mac OS 11.x)
#
# Inactive when commented out (Takes no action on SIP and SSV)
#
#active_csr 1

# Set arbitrary boot arguments on Mac OS. When this option is active,
# RefindPlus will change the boot arguments in Mac OS to the specified string.
# This setting only applies to Mac OS and accounts for arguments injected by
# "disable_amfi" and "disable_compat_check" as required. Note that this
# will create a Mac OS boot argument the first time it is triggered
# and that this will stay active until explicitly cleared even if
# the setting is subsequently disabled.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not change boot arguments)
#
#set_boot_args "-v"

##           Existing Features Modified in RefindPlus           ##
##--------------------------------------------------------------##
#
#
# Launch specified loader in graphics mode. RefindPlus defaults to
# text mode and displays basic pre-launch information when launching
# any operating systems except Mac OS. Using graphics mode can provide
# a more seamless transition, but may not display any information, which
# can make it difficult to debug problems. However, using graphics mode
# may prevent crashes in some instances. Specifying an empty list
# will set RefindPlus to boot all loaders in text mode.
# Valid options:
#   linux       - A Linux kernel with EFI stub loader
#   grub        - The GRUB (Legacy or 2) boot loader
#   opencore    - The OpenCore boot loader
#   clover      - The Clover boot loader
#   elilo       - The ELILO boot loader
#   windows     - Microsoft Windows
#   osx         - Mac OS
#
# Uses osx (Launches Mac OS in graphics mode) when commented out
#
#use_graphics_for osx,linux

# While using NVRAM works with most computers, this can increase wear
# and tear on the motherboard's NVRAM. In situations where the NVRAM is
# old and worn out, it may fail to work and lead to an inability to boot.
# Storing variables on disk is a viable alternative and RefindPlus can save
# its variables to a folder on the filesystem instead. However, this will not
# work if RefindPlus is on a filesystem that is read-only to the EFI, such as
# HFS+ volumes. In such cases, an attempt to write to the first ESP RefindPlus
# can identify will be made. If this attempt is not sucessful, the variable will
# not be saved and this fact will be logged if running the debug version. NB: This
# option only applies to RefindPlus variables such as the PreviousBoot, HiddenTags,
# HiddenTools, and HiddenLegacy variables and does not apply to any variables from
# other processes/libraries (These are always written to the motherboard's NVRAM).
#
# Stores RefindPlus variables to the filesystem when commented out

# Set the screen's display resolution. Pass this option either:
#       * two values, corresponding to the X and Y resolutions
#       * one value, corresponding to a GOP (UEFI) video mode
# Note that not all resolutions are supported. On UEFI 2.x systems,
# passing an incorrect value results in a message being shown on the
# screen to that effect, along with a list of supported modes. With
# EFI 1.x systems, such as legacy Macs, setting an incorrect mode
# silently fails. On both types of systems, setting an incorrect
# resolution results in the default resolution being used.

#
#
# Normally, when the timeout period has passed, RefindPlus boots the
# default_selection. If the following option is uncommented, though,
# RefindPlus will instead attempt to shut down the computer.
#
# CAUTION: MANY COMPUTERS WILL HANG OR REBOOT INSTEAD! Macs and more

# (Excluding modifier keys such as Shift, Control, Alt, and Option).
# "-1" causes RefindPlus to start up with the screensaver active.
#
# The screensaver is diabled when commented out
#
#screensaver 300

# Hide user interface elements for personal preference or for security:
#  banner      - the RefindPlus title banner (built-in or loaded via "banner")
#  label       - boot option text label in the menu
#  singleuser  - remove the submenu options to boot Mac OS in single-user
#                or verbose modes; affects ONLY Mac OS
#  safemode    - remove the submenu option to boot Mac OS in "safe mode"
#  hwtest      - the submenu option to run Apple's hardware test
#  arrows      - scroll arrows on the OS selection tag line
#  hints       - brief command summary in the menu
#  editor      - the options editor (+, F2, or Insert on boot options menu)
#  badges      - device-type badges for boot options
#  all         - all of the above
#
# All elements are active when commented out
#
#hideui singleuser
#hideui all

# Set the name of a subdirectory in which icons are stored. Icons must
# have the same names they have in the standard directory. The directory
# name is specified relative to the main RefindPlus binary's directory. If
# an icon cannot be found in the specified directory, an attempt is made
# to load it from the default directory; thus, you can replace just some
# icons in your own directory and rely on the default for others. Icon
# files may be in any supported format -- ICNS (*.icns), BMP (*.bmp),
# PNG (*.png), or JPEG (*.jpg or *.jpeg); however, RefindPlus' BMP
# and JPEG implementations do not support transparency, which is
# highly desirable in icons.
#
# Loads icons from the "icons" folder when commented out
#
#icons_dir myicons
#icons_dir icons/snowy

# Use a custom title banner instead of the default embedded banner. The
# file path is relative to the directory where the RefindPlus efi file is
# located. The colour in the top left corner of the image is used for the
# background colour for the menu screens. Currently uncompressed BMP files
# with colour depths of 24, 8, 4 or 1 bits are supported, as well as PNG and
# JPEG files. ICNS files can also be used but have limitations that make them
# poor choices for this purpose. Some PNG and JPEG features are not supported
# and some files, such as progressive JPEG files, cannot be used.
#
# Uses the default title banner when commented out
#

#banner icons/snowy/banner-snowy.png

# How to handle banners that are not the same size as the screen size:
#  noscale     - Crop if too big or show with border if too small
#  fillscreen  - Fill the screen
#
# Crops if too big or shows with border if too small when commented out
#
#banner_scale fillscreen

# Icon sizes. All icons are square, so just one value is specified. The
# big icons are used for OS selectors in the first row and the small icons
# are used for tools on the second row. Drive-type badges are 1/4 the size
# of the big icons. Legal values are 32 and above. If the icon files do not
# hold icons of the proper size, the icons are scaled to the specified size.
#
# Uses 48 and 128 for small and big icons respectively when commented out
#
#small_icon_size 96
#big_icon_size 256

# Custom images for the selection background. There is a big one (144 x 144)
# for the OS icons, and a small one (64 x 64) for the function icons in the
# second row. If only a small image is given, that one is also used for the
# big icons by stretching it in the middle. If only a big one is given, the
# built-in default will be used for the small icons. If an image other than
# the optimal size is specified, it may be scaled in an ugly way.
#
# Like the banner option above, these options take a filename of an
# uncompressed BMP, PNG, JPEG, or ICNS image file with a color depth
# of 24, 8, 4, or 1 bits. The PNG or ICNS format is required for
# transparency support.
#
#selection_big   selection-big.bmp
#selection_small selection-small.bmp

# Set the font to be used for all textual displays in graphics mode.
# For the best results, The font used should be a PNG file with alpha
# channel transparency. It must contain ASCII characters 32-126 (space
# through tilde), inclusive, aswell as a glyph to be displayed in place
# of characters outside this range (96 glyphs in total). Only monospaced
# fonts are supported. Fonts may be of any size, although large fonts can
# produce display irregularities.
#
# Uses the built-in font (Luxi Mono Regular 12 point) when commented out
#
#font myfont.png

# Use text screen mode. When enabled, this option forces the RefindPlus
# screen mode to text mode. Graphics screen mode is used otherwise.
#
# Uses graphics screen mode when commented out
#
#textonly

# Set the EFI text mode to be used for textual displays. This option
# takes a single digit that refers to a mode number. Mode 0 is normally
# 80x25, 1 is sometimes 80x50, and higher numbers are system-specific
# modes. Mode 1024 is a special code that tells RefindPlus to not set the
# text mode; it uses whatever was in use when the program was launched.
# If you specify an invalid mode, RefindPlus pauses during boot to inform
# you of valid modes.
#
# CAUTION: On VirtualBox, and perhaps on some real computers, specifying
# a text mode and uncommenting the "textonly" option without specifying
# a resolution can result in an unusable display in the booted OS.
#
# Uses 1024 when commented out
#
#textmode 2

# Enable touch screen support. If active, this feature enables use of
# touch screen controls (as on tablets). Note, however, that not all
# tablet EFIs provide the necessary underlying support, so this
# feature may not work for you. If it does work, you should be able
# to launch an OS or tool by touching it. In a submenu, touching
# anywhere launches the currently-selection item; there is, at present,
# no way to select a specific submenu item. This feature is mutually
# exclusive with the enable_mouse feature. If both are uncommented,
# the one read most recently takes precedence.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not enable touch screen support)
#
#enable_touch

# Enable mouse support. If active, this feature enables use of the
# computer's mouse. Note, however, that not all computer EFIs
# provide the necessary underlying support, so this feature may not
# work for you. If it does work, you should be able to launch an
# OS or tool by clicking it with the mouse pointer. This feature
# is mutually exclusive with the enable_touch feature. If both
# are uncommented, the one read most recently takes precedence.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not enable mouse support)
#
#enable_mouse

# Size of the mouse pointer, in pixels, per side.
#
# The default setting is 16
#
#mouse_size 18

# Speed of mouse tracking. Higher numbers equate to faster
# mouse movement. This option requires that enable_mouse be
# uncommented. Legal values are between 1 and 32.
#
# The default setting is 4
#
#mouse_speed 6

# Tool binaries to be excluded from the tools line, even if the
# general class is specified in showtools. This enables trimming an
# overabundance of tools, as when you see multiple mok_tool entries
# after installing multiple Linux distributions.
# Just as with dont_scan_files, you can specify a filename alone, a
# full pathname, or a volume identifier (filesystem label, partition
# name, or partition GUID) and a full pathname.

#windows_recovery_files LRS_ESP:/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/LrsBootmgr.efi

# Directories in which to search for EFI drivers. These drivers can
# provide filesystem support, give access to hard disks on plug-in
# controllers, etc. In most cases none are needed, but if you add
# EFI drivers and you want RefindPlus to automatically load them, you
# should specify one or more paths here. RefindPlus always scans the
# "drivers" and "drivers_{arch}" subdirectories of its own installation
# directory (where "{arch}" is your architecture code); this option
# specifies ADDITIONAL directories to scan.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not scan additional directories)
#
#scan_driver_dirs EFI/tools/drivers,drivers

# Which types of boot loaders to search, and in what order to display them:
#  internal      - internal EFI disk-based boot loaders
#  external      - external EFI disk-based boot loaders
#  optical       - EFI optical discs (CD, DVD, etc.)
#  netboot       - EFI network (PXE) boot options
#  hdbios        - BIOS disk-based boot loaders
#  biosexternal  - BIOS external boot loaders (USB, eSATA, etc.)
#  cd            - BIOS optical-disc boot loaders
#  manual        - use stanzas later in this configuration file
#  firmware      - boot EFI programs set in the firmware's NVRAM
# Note that the legacy BIOS options require firmware support, which is
# not present on all computers.
# The netboot option is experimental and relies on the ipxe.efi and
# ipxe_discover.efi program files.
#
# On UEFI PCs, the default setting is internal,external,optical,manual
# On Macs, the default setting is internal,hdbios,external,biosexternal,optical,cd,manual
#
#scanfor internal,external,optical,manual

# By default, RefindPlus relies on the UEFI firmware to detect BIOS-mode boot
# devices. However, this sometimes does not detect all the available devices.
# For these cases, uefi_deep_legacy_scan results in a forced scan and
# modification of NVRAM variables on each boot. This option has no
# effect on Macs or when no BIOS-mode options are set via scanfor.
#
# Inactive when commented out (Does not result in a forced scan)
#

# When scanning volumes for EFI boot loaders, RefindPlus always looks for
# the Mac OS and Microsoft Windows boot loaders in their normal locations,
# and scans the root directory and every subdirectory of the /EFI directory
# for additional boot loaders, but does not recurse into these directories.
# The "also_scan_dirs" option adds more directories to the scan list and
# directories are specified relative to the volume's root directory. This
# option applies to ALL the volumes that RefindPlus scans UNLESS a volume
# name and a colon are included before the directory name (myvol:/somedir)
# to scan the somedir directory only on the filesystem named "myvol". If a
# specified directory does not exist, it is ignored (no error message).

#also_scan_dirs boot,ESP2:EFI/linux/kernels

# Partitions (or whole disks, for legacy-mode boots) to omit from scans.
# For "EFI-mode" scans, volumes are typically specified by their labels,
# which can be obtained in an EFI shell with "vol", from Linux by typing
# "blkid /dev/{devicename}", or by examining the disk's label in various
# operating system file browsers. Partitions can alsobe identified by the
# unique GUIDs ("PARTUUID" in Linux parlance). (Note that this is NOT the
# partition TYPE CODE GUID.) This identifier can be obtained using "blkid"
# in Linux or "diskutil info {partition-id}" in Mac OS. For legacy-mode
# scans, any subset of the boot loader description shown when the option
# is highlighted in RefindPlus can be used.
#
# Set to LRS_ESP when commented out
#
#dont_scan_volumes "Recovery HD"

# Directories that should NOT be scanned for boot loaders. By default,
# RefindPlus does not scan its own directory, the com.apple.recovery.boot,
# EFI/tools, EFI/memtest and EFI/memtest86 directories. The "dont_scan_dirs"
# option enables blocking other directories. However, "+" must be used as the
# first element to continue blocking existing directories. This option might be
# used to keep EFI/boot/bootx64.efi out of the menu if that is a duplicate of
# another boot loader, to exclude directories that hold drivers or to exclude
# directories with non-bootloader utilities from a hardware manufacturer.
# This token takes precedence if a directory is listed both here and in
# "also_scan_dirs". Note that this applies to ALL the filesystems that
# RefindPlus scans, and not just the ESP, unless the directory name is
# preceded by a filesystem name or partition unique GUID, such as
# "myvol:EFI/somedir", to exclude EFI/somedirfrom the scan on the
# "myvol" volume but not on other volumes.

# Files that should NOT be included as EFI boot loaders (on the
# first line of the display). To be used when using a boot loader
# that relies on support programs or drivers that are installed
# alongside the main binary or to block certain loaders by name
# rather than by location. Note that this will NOT prevent some
# binaries from showing up in the second-row set of tools. Most
# notably, various Secure Boot and recovery tools are present in
# this list, but may appear as second-row items. The file may be
# specified as a bare name (e.g., "notme.efi"), as a full pathname
# (e.g., "/EFI/somedir/notme.efi"), or as a complete pathname with
# volume (e.g., "SOMEDISK:/EFI/somedir/notme.efi" or
# 2C17D5ED-850D-4F76-BA31-47A561740082:/EFI/somedir/notme.efi").

# (where "{arch}" is the architecture code, like "x64").

# "Boot####" variables that should NOT be offered as loaders

# description field -- if a value here is a case-insensitive substring

# in quotes. Specifying "shell" will counteract the automatic
# inclusion of built-in EFI shells.

#dont_scan_firmware HARDDISK,shell,"Removable Device"

# Scan for Linux kernels that lack a ".efi" filename extension. This
# is useful for better integration with Linux distributions that provide
# kernels with EFI stub loaders but that do not give those kernels filenames
# that end in ".efi", particularly if the kernels are stored on a filesystem
# that the EFI can read. When active, this option causes all files in scanned
# directories with names that begin with "vmlinuz", "bzImage", or "kernel" to
# be included as loaders, even if they lack ".efi" extensions.

#fold_linux_kernels

# Comma-delimited list of strings to treat as if they were numbers for the
# purpose of kernel version number detection. These strings are matched on a
# first-found basis; that is, if you want to treat both "linux-lts" and
# "linux" as version strings, they MUST be specified as "linux-lts,linux",
# since if you specify it the other way, both vmlinuz-linux and
# vmlinuz-linux-lts will return with "linux" as the "version string," which
# is not desirable. Also, if the kernel or initrd file includes both a
# specified string and digits, the "version string" includes both. For
# instance, "vmlinuz-linux-4.8" would yield a version string of "linux-4.8".
# This option is intended for Arch and other distributions that do not include
# version numbers in their kernel filenames, but may provide other uniquely
# identifying strings for multiple kernels. If this feature causes problems
# (say, if your kernel filename includes "linux" but the initrd filename
# does not), be sure this is set to an empty string
# (extra_kernel_version_strings "") or comment out the option to disable it.

#  - A digit between 1 and 9, in which case the Nth loader in the menu
#    will be the default.
#  - A "+" symbol at the start of the string, which refers to the most
#    recently booted loader.
#  - Any substring that corresponds to a portion of the loader's title
#    (usually the OS's name, boot loader's path, or a volume or
#    filesystem title).
# You may also specify multiple selectors by separating them with commas
# and enclosing the list in quotes. (The "+" option is only meaningful in
# this context.)
# If you follow the selector(s) with two times, in 24-hour format, the
# default will apply only between those times. The times are in the
# motherboard's time standard, whether that is UTC or local time, so if
# you use UTC, you will need to adjust this from local time manually.
# Times may span midnight as in "23:30 00:30", which applies to 11:30 PM
# to 12:30 AM. You may specify multiple default_selection lines, in which
# case the last one to match takes precedence. Thus, you can set a main
# option without a time followed by one or more that include times to

# Tell a Mac's EFI that Mac OS is about to be launched, even when it is not.
# This option causes some Macs to initialize their hardware differently than
# when a third-party OS is launched normally. In some cases (particularly on
# Macs with multiple video cards), using this option can cause hardware to
# work that would not otherwise work. On the other hand, using this option
# when it is not necessary can cause hardware (such as keyboards and mice) to
# become inaccessible. Therefore, you should not enable this option if your
# non-Apple operating systems work correctly; enable it only if you have problems
# with some hardware devices. When needed, a value of "10.9" usually works, but
# you can experiment with other values. This feature has no effect on

# Sample manual configuration stanzas. Each begins with the "menuentry"
# keyword followed by a name that is to appear in the menu (use quotes
# if you want the name to contain a space) and an open curly brace
# ("{"). Each entry ends with a close curly brace ("}"). Common
# keywords within each stanza include:
#
#  volume    - identifies the filesystem from which subsequent files
#              are loaded. You can specify the volume by filesystem
#              label, by partition label, or by partition GUID number
#              (but NOT yet by filesystem UUID number).
#  loader    - identifies the boot loader file
#  initrd    - Specifies an initial RAM disk file
#  icon      - specifies a custom boot loader icon
#  ostype    - OS type code to determine boot options available by
#              pressing Insert. Valid values are "MacOS", "Linux",
#              "Windows", and "XOM". Case-sensitive.
#  graphics  - set to "on" to enable graphics-mode boot (useful
#              mainly for MacOS) or "off" for text-mode boot.
#              The default setting is auto-detected from the
#              loader filename.
#  options   - sets options to be passed to the boot loader; use
#              quotes if more than one option should be passed or
#              if any options use characters that might be changed
#              by RefindPlus parsing procedures (=, /, #, or tab).
#  disabled  - use alone or set to "yes" to disable this entry.
#
# Note that you can use either DOS/Windows/EFI-style backslashes (\)
# or Unix-style forward slashes (/) as directory separators. Either
# way, all file references are on the ESP from which RefindPlus was
# launched.
# Use of quotes around parameters causes them to be interpreted as
# one keyword, and for parsing of special characters (spaces, =, /,
# and #) to be disabled. This is useful mainly with the "options"
# keyword. Use of quotes around parameters that specify filenames is
# permissible, but you must then use backslashes instead of slashes,
# except when you must pass a forward slash to the loader, as when
# passing a root= option to a Linux kernel.
